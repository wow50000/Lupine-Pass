LYFE 1:2... And when PSYDONIA was finally wrought from star-and-clay, HE wearily looked upon his works and deemed it good; such christened the first SABBATH, and the first dae-of-rest.
LYFE 2:16... To bring LYFE to PSYDONIA, HE molded the first MAN in HIS image; and by scraping LUX into their body, so to did HE gift them the divine connection to thought-and-will.
LYFE 3:27... When HE had used the last clumps for MAN, it was PSYDONIA's animals who were brought forth to complete HIS world; a union of both MAN and MER, under HIS light.

LYFE 41:3... From the stars, there came a terrible sickness; a sudden malaise that violated the hearts of HIS children with sin, and brought forth the first murder.
LYFE 42:23... This was the ARCHDEVIL's terror; the antithesis to LYFE, who - driven by jealousy and hatred towards HIM - sought nothing less than to bring PSYDONIA to ruin.
LYFE 43:61... Yet, those who kept faith in HIM were promised eternity in the paradise-to-come; even as the ARCHDEVIL sired its ARMY OF DARKNESS, and even as HELL's jaws clamped onto PSYDONIA.

LYFE 74:3... Before the BASIN, upon the precipice of PSYDONIA's collapse, did SYON's COMET sail; a blinding light that destroyed the ARCHDEVIL and - at last - drove its wretched forces back into HELL.
LYFE 75:19... HE had given everything to save PSYDONIA, and had fallen into a thoughtless slumber; with what little strength remained, HE sired HIS SAINTS to shepherd LYFE in HIS absence.
LYFE 77:7... Just as HE did, so too must MAN now endure; for the ARCHDEVIL's PROTIGEE and her UNHOLY TRINITY's temporary pleasures musn't outlast the eternal faith of PSYDON's children.
